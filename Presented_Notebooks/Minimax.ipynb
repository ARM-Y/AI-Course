Its goal is to find the optimal move for a player, assuming the opponent will also play optimally.\n\n**Core Idea:**\n\nThe algorithm explores all possible moves down to a certain depth (or the end of the game). It assigns a value to each terminal state (win, loss, or draw) from the perspective of one player (the \"maximizing\" player).\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n1.  **Maximizing Player:** Tries to choose the move that leads to the highest possible score.\n2.  **Minimizing Player:** Tries to choose the move that leads to the lowest possible score (from the maximizer's perspective).\n\nThe algorithm recursively alternates between these two players. At each level of the game tree:\n\n* The **maximizing player** takes the **maximum** of the values of its children.\n* The **minimizing player** takes the **minimum** of the values of its children.\n\nBy propagating these values up the game tree, the maximizing player can determine the move that guarantees the best possible outcome, assuming optimal play from the opponent.\n\n**In essence, minimax anticipates the opponent's best moves and chooses a strategy that minimizes the potential loss (or maximizes the potential gain).**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Important Implication:** So you must expect that this strategy does not yield the best result playing against a player who won't play optimally.

It sets the human player as 'X' and the AI as 'O'. The game proceeds in a loop that continues until a win or a draw occurs. In each turn, the current board is displayed using the `print_board` function. If it's the human player's turn, they are prompted to enter their desired row and column. Input validation ensures the move is within the board boundaries and the chosen cell is empty. If the move is valid, the board is updated, and the function checks for a win or a draw. If it's the AI's turn, the `find_best_move` function (utilizing the `minimax` algorithm with the specified `depth`) is called to determine the optimal move, which is then played on the board. After each move, the function checks for a win or a draw. The game loop continues by switching the `current_player`. The game ends when a player wins or the board is full, and the result is printed.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def play_game(depth):\n\n    # Initialize the board\n    board = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # The user will be the \"X\" player\n    current_player = 'X'\n\n    # Main Engine\n    while True:\n        \n        print_board(board)\n\n        # Player \"X\"\n        if current_player == 'X':\n            row, col = map(int, input(\"Enter row and column (0-2) for X, separated by space: \").split())\n            \n            if 0 <= row < 3 and 0 <= col < 3 and board[row][col] == ' ':\n                board[row][col] = 'X'\n                \n                if check_win(board, 'X'):\n                    print_board(board)\n                    print(\"X wins!\")\n                    break\n                    \n                if not get_empty_cells(board):\n                    print_board(board)\n                    print(\"It's a draw!\")\n                    break\n    \n                current_player = 'O'\n                \n            else:\n                print(\"Invalid move.

It dictates how many levels of the game tree the algorithm explores when evaluating potential moves.\n\n* **Shallow Depth:** A smaller depth value means the AI looks fewer moves ahead. This results in faster computation but potentially less optimal moves, as the AI cannot foresee the long-term consequences of its actions. The AI might make seemingly good immediate moves that lead to disadvantages later in the game.\n\n* **Greater Depth:** A larger depth value allows the AI to explore more possible future game states. This leads to more informed and often optimal decision-making, as the AI can anticipate the opponent's responses and plan accordingly. However, increasing the depth significantly increases the computational cost, potentially leading to slower AI response times, especially for more complex games with larger branching factors.\n\nFor Tic-Tac-Toe, with its relatively small game tree, a sufficient depth (e.g., 9, which explores all possible moves to the end of the game) allows the AI to play perfectly, guaranteeing at least a draw if the opponent also plays optimally. In more complex games, finding the right balance for the depth parameter is crucial to achieve a challenging yet responsive AI opponent.","metadata":{}}]}
